## Folder Structure

### video_editing

Tutorials and example scripts for video manipulation, each with corresponding input/output folders.

### tts

Scripts for text-to-speech using TikTok and ElevenLabs, organized by tiktok and elevenlabs subfolders.

- tiktok:

  - voices.py: Lists available voices.
  - tiktok-tts.py: Main TTS processing script.
  - helper_conf_tts.py: A helper script.
  - tiktok_tts/: Contains:
    - script.txt: Enter the script here, separating sections with ## (each section must be under 300 characters).
    - voice_model.txt: Specify the voice model code.
  - output_tiktok_tts: Outputs are saved here as .mp3 file.

- elevenlabs:

  - elevenlabs_tts.py: Main script for ElevenLabs TTS processing.
  - helper_config.py: A helper script.
  - eleven_labs_tts/: Contains:
    - script.txt: Enter the script, separating sections with ##.
    - voice_model.txt: Specify the voice model name (available on ElevenLabs).
  - output_eleven_labs_tts: Outputs are saved here as .mp3 file.

### pexels

Scripts for downloading images and videos from Pexels. Configure search parameters directly in each script.

- pexels-images.py: Script to retrieve images based on user-defined parameters (query, per_page, and page).
- pexels-videos.py: Script to retrieve videos with similar parameters.
- Retrieved files are saved in the images and videos folders.

### templates

Practical templates for specific use cases:
comments: Creates a narrated video based on comment images.
educational: Generates educational videos with or without background audio.
news: Builds news videos by fetching the latest headlines.
podcast: Produces a podcast-style video with multiple speakers.
story: Creates story-based videos using pre-structured scripts and images.
Each folder contains instructions on usage and configuration.

- templates: Contains five customizable video creation folders:

  - comments:

    - Structure: Folders (audios, comments, bg_music, bg_video) and files (helper.py, main.py).
    - Use: Place comment images in comments, background video in bg_video, audio files in audios, and background music in bg_music.
    - Requirements: Ensure the number of files in comments and audios match. The script in main.py synchronizes the audio and images to create a video.

  - educational:

    - Structure: background.mp3 file (replaceable, but must retain the same name), read.ms file for usage instructions.
    - Output: Generated media folder contains the final video in video. After generating, rename the file to final_video.mp4 and run combine_plus_bg_music.py to add background music.

  - news:

    - Structure: helper.py, main.py, and folders (audios, images, bg_video, bg_music).
    - Customization: Modify topheadlines in main.py to change the news source (e.g., bbc-news, us, or bitcoin) and set news_number.
    - Output: main.py creates a news video using TikTok TTS and images.

  - podcast:

    - Structure: main.py, helper.py, and folders (audios, image, bg_music, script).
    - Use: Add script text in script/script.txt (separate sections with ##), an image in image, and background music in bg_music.
    - Output: main.py generates a podcast-style video.

  - story:
    - Structure: silence.mp3 (for pauses between speech segments), main.py, helper.py, and folders (audios, images, script, bg_music).
    - Use: Add story text in script/script.txt (separate frames with ##, separate speakers within a frame with $$). Match the number of frames with images for visual synchronization.
    - Output: Generates a story video with sequential audio-visual segments.
